2020 Census data is delayed and will be affected by differential privacy.
This package uses FCC block-level population estimates from 2010--2019, which
are based on new roads and map data, to estimate 2020 block populations.  In
the future it may estimate other quantities of interest as well.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/blockpop")
