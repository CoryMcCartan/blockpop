2020 Census data is delayed and will be affected by differential
privacy. This package uses FCC block-level population estimates from
2010â€“2019, which are based on new roads and map data, to estimate 2020
block populations. In the future it may estimate other quantities of
interest as well.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
